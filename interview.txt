MACHINE LEARNING 
	1.Supervised learning(use labelled data to train model)
			a.classification(predicting a category ie will stock market go up or down) 
				-decision
				-naive bayes-email spam
				-random forest-can be used to assist in detection of anomalies in power grids to reduce power theft.
				-logistic regression
				-KNN(nearest neigbor)-to the nearest sample space e.g Paul's choice of music.
			b.Regression(no labelled data,predict quantity i.e person's age based on height,weight,health)
				-linear regression
				-polynomial regression
	2.Unsupervised learning
			a.clustering method(discover structure on unexplored data i.e find group of customers with similar behaviour for marketing purposes) 
				-K-Means clustering
	3.Reinforment learning(learning with feedback loop)-reward based learning
the more the data->the better the model->higher the accuracy.

forecasting-using machine learning using current business data to predict business position in the future and allow management 
			to make critical business.
business optimization is driven by the ability to generate actionable insights from data.

Key responsibilities
1.extensively using SQL in operational reports scripting and python on machine learning models development
2.forecasting-using traditional data analysis coupled with BI to inform current business position and machine learing models to predict future 
trends so that business can manage expectations accordingly.
3.very reasearch oriented individual,and always keen to learn on different technological advancements across industries,including the mining 
industry where diamonds play a key role.
4.very good with data management practices,reports development and working with different database technologies(Oracle,SQL Server and Posgres)
5.touch on usage data analysis and AI.

currently with Botswana Power as Data Scientist(9 months)
previously worked at Letshego as Data Specialist(8 years)
very good with data visualization tools i.e Power BI.
